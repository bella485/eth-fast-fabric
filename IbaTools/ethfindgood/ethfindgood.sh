#	alive - list of pingable hosts
#	running - subset of alive which can be sshed to via ethcmdall
#	active - list of hosts with 1 or more active ports
#	good - list of hosts which are running and active
#	bad - list of hosts which fail any of the above tests
# The intent is that the good list can be a candidate list of hosts for
# use in running MPI jobs to further use or test the cluster

# optional override of defaults
